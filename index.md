  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  <h3>The Bash Shell</h3>

  <p>
    Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple
    tasks more quickly. We will supply participants access to a VM running Linux.

      <h4 id="shell-windows">Windows</h4>
      We will supply Windows participants access to a VM running Linux. For Windows computers please install PuTTY. PuTTY is an SSH and telnet client. Install from <a href="http://www.putty.org/">PuTTY installer</a> or or if using a USQ computer from within USQ install from <a href="https://kace.usq.edu.au/userui/software_detail.php?ID=452">USQ KACE</a>.

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-macosx">macOS</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell in all versions of macOS is Bash, so no
        need to install anything.  You access Bash from the Terminal
        (found in
        <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).
        See the Git installation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY ">video tutorial</a>
        for an example on how to open the Terminal.
        You may want to keep
        Terminal in your dock for this workshop.

        The default shell is usually Bash, but if your
        machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a
        terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.  There is no need to
        install anything.

  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words. We will use Nano which will be pre-installed in the supplied VM.
